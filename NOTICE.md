# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies exploring extreme, theoretical, speculative, and sometimes
intentionally impractical ideas related to planetary cooling and engineering.

The **Space Straw** project examines whether a planetary atmosphere could be
reduced by directly venting gas into space via a continuous conduit. It is
presented as a physics-based thought experiment, not as a proposal for
construction, implementation, or policy.

Concepts discussed here are grounded in established physical principles where
possible, including compressible gas dynamics, gravity, and atmospheric
structure. Some extensions are speculative and are clearly framed as such.

No claim is made regarding feasibility, originality of scientific principles, or
priority over existing research. Foundational physics, equations, and scientific
knowledge belong to the global scientific community and are used here in good
faith.

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, analysis, and presentation** of
this project as an educational and comparative study.

This work is shared openly to encourage critical thinking, scale intuition, and
an honest examination of why many large-scale planetary engineering ideas fail
when confronted with real constraints.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or
repository is appreciated.
