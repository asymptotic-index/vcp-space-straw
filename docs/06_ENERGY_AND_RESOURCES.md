# Energy and Resources
Space Straw — Venus Cooling Project

## Purpose of This Document

This document quantifies the **energy and resource requirements** associated with
the Space Straw concept. The goal is not to optimize a design, but to establish
**lower-bound energy costs** imposed by physics.

---

## Gravitational Energy Requirement

To permanently remove atmospheric gas from Venus, the gas must:
- Reach escape velocity, or
- Be transferred elsewhere with equivalent energy cost

Venus escape velocity:

vₑ ≈ 10.36 km/s

Minimum energy per unit mass:

Eₑ = ½ vₑ²  
Eₑ ≈ 5.4 × 10⁷ J/kg

This value represents an **absolute minimum**, assuming perfect efficiency.

---

## Total Atmospheric Energy Scale

Total atmospheric mass of Venus:

M ≈ 4.8 × 10²⁰ kg

Total energy required to remove the entire atmosphere:

E_total ≈ 2.6 × 10²⁸ J

This value ignores:
- Compression losses
- Transport inefficiencies
- Structural overhead

It is therefore an optimistic lower bound.

---

## Power-Limited Removal Example

Assume an extremely optimistic continuous power supply:

P = 10 terawatts (10¹³ W)

Time required to remove entire atmosphere:

t = E_total / P  
t ≈ 8 × 10⁷ years

This assumes:
- No interruptions
- Perfect energy coupling
- No system degradation

---

## Compression Energy

Before escape, gas must often be compressed for transport.

Isothermal compression work per kilogram (order of magnitude):

W ≈ 10⁵ J/kg

While small compared to escape energy, compression becomes dominant if gas is
moved but not fully removed.

---

## Structural Resource Requirements

Even ignoring feasibility, a conduit would require:
- Planetary-scale structural mass
- Continuous maintenance
- Resistance to heat, pressure, and corrosion

These costs scale with system size and duration, not flow rate.

---

## Energy Sources Considered

No exotic energy sources are assumed.

Potential sources include:
- Solar energy (≈1.9× Earth’s solar flux)
- Nuclear fission or fusion (hypothetical at scale)

Regardless of source, energy conservation dominates outcomes.

## Key Insight

> Energy, not pressure, is the governing currency  
> of atmospheric removal.

Any concept that appears to “cheat” energy requirements fails under scrutiny.

---

## Summary

- Minimum energy scales linearly with mass removed
- Passive systems cannot bypass gravitational costs
- Even optimistic power supplies imply geological timescales

The Space Straw concept is fundamentally **energy-limited**.
