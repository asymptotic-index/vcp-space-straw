# Scope and Ethics
Space Straw — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **scope**, **intent**, and **ethical framing** of the
Space Straw project. It exists to clearly separate analytical exploration from
advocacy, proposal, or endorsement.

---

## Project Scope

The Space Straw project is scoped as a **theoretical analysis** of a single idea:

> Whether a continuous conduit between a planetary atmosphere and space could
> meaningfully reduce atmospheric mass through passive or active venting.

The project focuses on:
- Order-of-magnitude physics
- First-principles constraints
- Failure modes driven by scale, gravity, and energy

The scope explicitly includes:
- Simplified models
- Optimistic assumptions (clearly stated)
- Extensions into speculative but physics-consistent variants

---

## Out of Scope

This project explicitly does **not** attempt to:
- Design a buildable system
- Address economic feasibility
- Propose governance or policy
- Evaluate military or strategic uses
- Advocate for planetary modification

Any resemblance to real engineering proposals is incidental and analytical only.

## Ethical Framing

Planetary-scale interventions raise significant ethical questions. This project
does not attempt to resolve those questions, but it does acknowledge them.

Key ethical positions adopted here:

- **Non-advocacy:**  
  The project does not argue that Venus *should* be modified.

- **Transparency:**  
  Assumptions, limitations, and failure modes are explicitly documented.

- **Educational Intent:**  
  The primary goal is to improve intuition about scale, not to promote action.

- **Respect for Science:**  
  Established research and known physics are treated as constraints, not obstacles
  to be hand-waved away.

## Responsibility and Misuse

Because this project discusses extreme ideas, it is important to clarify:

- The presence of an idea in this repository does not imply endorsement.
- Numerical analysis is used to show *why* ideas fail as often as to show how
  they might work in limited contexts.
- Simplifications are intentional and conservative unless otherwise stated.

---

## Relationship to Fantasy Concepts

Within the broader Venus Cooling Project, some repositories include intentionally
fantastical ideas. **Space Straw is not classified as fantasy**, but it is still
treated as a boundary-testing concept.

Where speculative extensions appear:
- They are labeled
- They remain constrained by energy and physics
- They are used for comparison, not escalation

---

## Summary

> This project exists to explore an idea honestly,  
> not to sell it, defend it, or build it.

Ethical clarity is a prerequisite for meaningful analysis at planetary scale.
