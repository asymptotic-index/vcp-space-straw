## Purpose

This document serves as a **reader reference guide** for terminology, symbols,
constants, and shorthand used throughout the Space Straw repository.

It is intended to:
- Reduce friction for non-specialist readers
- Clarify assumptions and notation
- Provide a single lookup location for recurring concepts

No new arguments are introduced here.

## Glossary — Core Concepts

### Atmosphere
A layer of gases gravitationally bound to a planetary body.

---

### Atmospheric Scale Height
The vertical distance over which atmospheric pressure decreases by a factor of *e*
(≈2.718).  
For Venus: ~15–16 km.

---

### Choked Flow
A condition in compressible fluid flow where gas velocity reaches the local speed
of sound (Mach 1) at a constriction, setting a maximum mass flow rate independent
of downstream pressure.

---

### Compressible Gas
A gas whose density changes significantly with pressure and temperature. All
planetary atmospheres are compressible.

---

### Escape Velocity
The minimum speed required for an object or gas parcel to permanently escape a
planet’s gravitational influence without further propulsion.

For Venus: ~10.36 km/s.

---

### Hydrostatic Equilibrium
The balance between downward gravitational force and upward pressure gradient in
a fluid, resulting in a stable atmospheric structure.

---

### Ideal Gas Approximation
A simplifying assumption that relates pressure, temperature, and density using
the ideal gas law. Used here for first-order analysis.

---

### Passive Venting
The removal of gas driven solely by pressure difference, without pumps or external
energy input.

---

### Active Extraction
Atmospheric removal using mechanical or thermal energy to move gas against gravity.

---

## Engineering and Systems Terms

### Aerostat
A buoyant structure (balloon or airship) that maintains altitude using lift from
the surrounding atmosphere.

---

### Conduit
A pipe, tube, or channel used to transport fluid or gas from one region to another.

---

### Mass Flow Rate
The amount of mass passing through a system per unit time, typically measured in
kg/s.

---

### Orbital Handling
Any process that stores, processes, or disposes of material after it reaches
near-space or orbit.
