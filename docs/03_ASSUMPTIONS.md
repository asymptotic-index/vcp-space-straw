# Assumptions
Space Straw — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** used throughout the Space Straw
analysis. All calculations, conclusions, and comparisons depend on these
assumptions remaining valid.

Where assumptions are optimistic, this is stated clearly.

---

## Planetary Assumptions

The analysis assumes the following baseline properties for Venus:

- Mean radius: ~6,051 km  
- Surface gravity: ~8.87 m/s²  
- Escape velocity: ~10.36 km/s  
- Total atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  

These values are treated as constant over the duration of the analysis.

---

## Atmospheric Composition Assumptions

Venus’s atmosphere is modeled as:
- ~96.5% carbon dioxide (CO₂)
- ~3.5% nitrogen (N₂)

Trace gases and aerosols are ignored unless explicitly mentioned.

The atmosphere is treated as an **ideal gas mixture** for first-order analysis.

---

## Thermodynamic Assumptions

- Ideal gas behavior is assumed
- Local thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed
- Temperature is treated as approximately constant within altitude bands
- Phase changes (e.g., CO₂ condensation) are ignored

These assumptions simplify analysis and bias results optimistically.

---

## Structural Assumptions

The hypothetical “straw” or conduit is assumed to:
- Be perfectly sealed
- Be mechanically stable
- Resist corrosion, heat, and pressure
- Have negligible leakage

These assumptions remove engineering feasibility from the analysis and isolate
physical limits.

---

## Flow Assumptions

- Gas flow is compressible
- Flow through constrictions reaches choked flow where applicable
- Turbulence and shock losses are ignored unless noted
- Flow is steady-state

These assumptions favor maximum possible mass throughput.

---

## Energy Assumptions

- No free or exotic energy sources are available
- Energy must be supplied via conventional means (solar, nuclear, etc.)
- 100% efficiency is assumed unless stated otherwise

Assuming perfect efficiency ensures energy limits presented are **lower bounds**.

---

## Time Horizon Assumptions

The analysis considers timescales ranging from:
- Thousands of years (short)
- Millions to billions of years (long)

Shorter timescales are considered unrealistic unless assumptions are violated.

---

## Human and Social Assumptions

Unless explicitly discussed:
- Economics are ignored
- Politics are ignored
- Governance is ignored
- Maintenance labor is ignored

The project is intentionally **physics-first**.

---

## Summary

> These assumptions intentionally remove practical obstacles  
> to expose fundamental physical constraints.

If the concept fails under these conditions, it cannot succeed under stricter real-world constraints.
