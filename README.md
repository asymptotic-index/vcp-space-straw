# Space Straw
**Reality Level:** Theoretical  
**Project Family:** Venus Cooling Project

---

## Overview

Space Straw explores the idea of whether a continuous conduit between a planetary atmosphere and space could be used to remove, redistribute, or process atmospheric gases.

The project examines a common intuition—that connecting a high-pressure atmosphere to the near-vacuum of space would allow gas to “vent” outward—and tests it against real physical constraints such as compressible gas dynamics, gravity, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy limits.

Rather than treating an atmosphere as a drainable container, Space Straw models it as a gravitationally bound, self-replenishing gas column. The analysis shows that passive venting through a straw-like structure quickly becomes limited by choked flow and atmospheric expansion, preventing runaway atmospheric loss.

The concept is then extended into more realistic variants, including:
* Active, pumped conduits rather than passive siphons
* High-altitude or aerostat-based intake instead of surface access
* Low-orbit handling and processing of extracted gases
* Industrial use cases such as resource extraction, sequestration, or radiative management rather than full atmospheric removal

Space Straw is not presented as a viable terraforming solution. Instead, it serves as a boundary-testing thought experiment that illustrates why planetary atmospheres resist simple mechanical solutions, and why large-scale intervention is dominated by energy, timescale, and mass-flow constraints.

The project is intended as an educational and comparative tool, helping build intuition about planetary engineering limits while distinguishing between physically grounded analysis, speculative extensions, and intentionally impractical ideas.

## Key Reference Numbers (Venus)

- Surface pressure: ~92 bar  
- Atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  
- Escape velocity: ~10.36 km/s  
- Atmospheric scale height: ~15–16 km  

These values define the dominant constraints explored throughout the project.
